            Chelsea are going to have to break the bank if they are to sign Moises Caicedo from Brighton & Hove Albion this summer.The Seagulls are making it extremely difficult for Moises Caicedo to leave the Amex Stadium.According to a report from 90min, they have now told their midfielder that he will not be sold unless their £100m valuation is met.Chelsea have already made a couple of big offers for him, with the same outlet claiming that their last one was worth £80m. But it looks like they will have to go much higher than that if they still want to bring the 21-year-old to Stamford bridge.
